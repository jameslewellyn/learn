# .cursorrules Files: Sharing Guide & Best Practices

*A comprehensive guide to .cursorrules files, their format, content, and the thriving community that shares them*

## üéØ Introduction

The `.cursorrules` file has emerged as one of the most powerful tools in the AI-assisted development ecosystem. These simple text files contain instructions that guide AI behavior, creating consistent, context-aware assistance across development sessions. What started as a personal configuration feature has evolved into a vibrant sharing community where developers exchange expertise, patterns, and domain knowledge.

This guide explores the `.cursorrules` file format, how people share them, and the most commonly shared types of rules that are transforming AI-assisted development.

## üìÅ Understanding .cursorrules Files

### **What is a .cursorrules File?**

A `.cursorrules` file is a plain text configuration file that provides context, constraints, and behavioral guidelines to AI assistants in Cursor IDE. Think of it as a **project-specific instruction manual** that the AI reads before helping with your code.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Plain text format**: Usually Markdown for readability
- **Project-specific**: Located in project root or subdirectories  
- **Persistent**: Instructions apply across all AI interactions in the project
- **Shareable**: Easy to copy, modify, and distribute

**Advanced .cursorrules with Context:**
```markdown
# E-commerce Platform Development Rules

You are a senior full-stack developer building a modern e-commerce platform using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

## Project Context
- B2B e-commerce platform for wholesale buyers
- High-volume transactions (10k+ orders/day)
- Multi-tenant architecture with role-based access
- Stripe payments with complex tax calculations
- Real-time inventory management

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Deployment**: Docker, AWS ECS, CloudFront CDN

## Development Standards
### Code Quality
- Use TypeScript strict mode with no `any` types
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Write unit tests for all business logic (80%+ coverage)
- Use React Testing Library for component tests

### Performance Requirements
- Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- API response times < 200ms for 95th percentile
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Implement progressive loading for large datasets

### Security Standards
- Validate all user inputs with Zod schemas
- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Encrypt all PII data at rest and in transit
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Business Logic Rules
- Use Decimal.js for all monetary calculations
- Implement audit trails for financial transactions
- Handle inventory with optimistic locking
- Support multiple currencies with real-time conversion

## Current Sprint Focus
- Implementing advanced product search with Elasticsearch
- Building real-time order tracking with WebSocket updates
- Creating admin dashboard for inventory management
- Setting up automated testing pipeline with Playwright

## Code Examples to Follow
```typescript
// Good: Proper error handling with types
type ApiResult<T> = {
  success: true;
  data: T;
} | {
  success: false;
  error: { code: string; message: string; };
};

// Good: Proper money handling
import { Decimal } from 'decimal.js';
const totalPrice = new Decimal(price).mul(quantity).toFixed(2);

// Good: Input validation
const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  age: z.number().min(18).max(120)
});
```

## Avoid These Patterns
- Don't use `any` type - use `unknown` or proper types
- Don't perform floating-point arithmetic on money
- Don't store passwords in plain text
- Don't expose internal error details to users
- Don't skip input validation on API endpoints
```

// Avoid this pattern
[counter-example]
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- [Specific anti-pattern 1]
- [Specific anti-pattern 2]
- [Specific anti-pattern 3]
```

**2. Specificity Over Generality**
```markdown
‚ùå Too Generic:
"Write clean, maintainable code"

‚úÖ Specific and Actionable:
"Use TypeScript strict mode with noImplicitAny: true and noImplicitReturns: true"

‚ùå Vague:
"Handle errors properly"

‚úÖ Specific:
"Wrap all async operations in try-catch blocks and return Result<T, Error> union types"
```

**3. Include Context and Rationale**
```markdown
## Database Queries
- Use Prisma ORM for all database operations
- Implement proper indexing for queries with WHERE clauses
- Use connection pooling with max 20 connections (prevents database overload)
- Always use transactions for multi-table operations (ensures data consistency)

## Why these rules?
Our application handles 10k+ concurrent users, so database performance is critical.
We've found these patterns prevent the most common performance issues.
```

**4. Provide Working Examples**
```markdown
## API Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
// Recommended error handling structure
type ApiResponse<T> = {
  success: true;
  data: T;
} | {
  success: false;
  error: {
    code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR' | 'SERVER_ERROR' | 'NOT_FOUND';
    message: string;
    details?: Record<string, string>;
  };
};

// Implementation example
async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<ApiResponse<User>> {
  try {
    const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id } });
    if (!user) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: { code: 'NOT_FOUND', message: 'User not found' }
      };
    }
    return { success: true, data: user };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: { code: 'SERVER_ERROR', message: 'Failed to fetch user' }
    };
  }
}
```
```

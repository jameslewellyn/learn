```typescript
type ApiResponse<T> = {
  success: true;
  data: T;
} | {
  success: false;
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: unknown;
  };
};

async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<ApiResponse<User>> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
    if (!response.ok) {
      return {
        success: false,
        error: {
          code: 'HTTP_ERROR',
          message: `HTTP ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`
        }
      };
    }
    const user = await response.json();
    return { success: true, data: user };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: {
        code: 'NETWORK_ERROR',
        message: 'Failed to fetch user data',
